## Description
**PowerOpsToolKit** is a personal and evolving collection of modern PowerShell scripts for offensive Windows operations — created to replace outdated and unreliable tools often shared in red team tutorials and blog posts.

Many legacy tools are over 5 years old and incompatible with modern Active Directory environments. This toolkit rewrites and modernizes those techniques for real-world use in:

- Active Directory reconnaissance
- Privilege escalation
- WMI access validation
- Lateral movement
- Internal access enumeration

This project is being built and tested continuously as I explore deeper into offensive PowerShell. Expect active updates, clean code, and real-world applicability.
